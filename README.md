# Phase
Phase is a dynamically typed programming language with a syntax similar to that of Python and Scheme.
You can run Phase files with the command `python3 phase_main.py FILENAME.phs`. You can test this with the example file in the directory. You can also use the read-eval-print-loop (REPL) by omitting the filename: `python3 phase_main.py`.
